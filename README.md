# Youtube playlist player

This is my first application on React, my 'Hello World'. It's not really useful
but implements most of React behaviors, so it was good for training.

I consciously didn't used any libraries or helper dependencies. The only one thing
is Bootstrap CSS library to speed up styling.

I understand that there is a lot of improvements can be made. I already thought about
implementing idea of Reactive Forms and good Http client. But it will turn this small
tutorial project into something big and absolutely other.

## Usage
This application can be used as is or as a component. With this in mind there is a 'lib'
directory in 'src' which exports one main component "YPMainComponent" that can be
imported in any application. Must be used with only one property "apiKey" which is 
Youtube API key.
